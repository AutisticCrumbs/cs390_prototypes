1.  What player activity am I prototyping here?
	I am prototyping a dexterity shooting game where the player has to hit targets.
2. What game verbs am I investigating?    
	Aiming, shooting.
3. What kind of experience does this player activity produce?    
	It produces the experience of having to find targets quickly enough to shoot at.
4. What tone or mood does the player activity have?    
	The mood is stressful and a bit anxious.
5. What interesting gameplay and story things can I do with this player activity right now?    
	I can have the targets become interactable and random times.
6. How much could I do with this player activity if I had the time to devise different situations and scenarios in which to use it?    
	I could add multiple targets, I could make different types of weapons to shoot (semi-auto, long recharge, and full-auto firing speeds), I could make the ranmdom targets spawn one at a time or have multiple appear at once, and I could make the targets become uninteractable once they are hit.
7. What question am I trying to answer with this prototype?
	Do aim-focused games help people with hand-eye coordination?

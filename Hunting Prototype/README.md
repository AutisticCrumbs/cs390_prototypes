1. â€…What player activity am I prototyping here
This is a survivalist-inspired hunting game. The prototype has the player hunt deer and bring the 
deer back to the house before the enemies get to the player. The player can drop the deer but at 
the cost of losing points for having the dead deer on the ground.
2. What game verbs am I investigating?
Searching the area for deer, aiming and shooting at the deer, deciding the best time to drop the 
deer.
3. What kind of experience does this player activity produce?
I wanted to have a worried feeling due to being chased by enemies while doing another task. I felt 
that I succeeded in this by making enemies constantly spawn until you deposit the deer carcas at 
the house. I feel that thiss is a double-edged sword due to a player seeing these enemies and 
shooting them constantly and wondering wwhy they keep appearing.
4. What tone or mood does the player activity have?
The players feel a sense of stress knowing that they are being chased by enemies and having to 
decide between droping the deer early or to hold out until the last second to kill the enemies. 
5. What interesting gameplay and story things can I do with this player activity right now?
I could add multiple deer to the game at once to let the player pick and choose which deer to shoot
at first.
6. How much could I do with this player activity if I had the time to devise different situations 
and scenarios in which to use it? 
I could add different kinds of animals to hunt to spice up what the player is hunting for. I could
add a timer to the game itself to makee the player kill as many deer as possible to get as many
points as possible, like a high score system.
7. What question am I trying to answer with this prototype?
How long should the player wait before shooting an enemy while carrying an item?
